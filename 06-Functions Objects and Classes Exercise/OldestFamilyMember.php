/*
  Problem 18. Oldest Family Member
  
  Create class Person with fields name and age. Create a class Family. The class should have list of people, 
  method for adding members (void addMember(Person member)) and a method returning the oldest family member (Person getOldestMember()). 
  Write a program that reads name and age for N people and adds them to the family. Then print the name and age of the oldest member.
  If youâ€™ve defined the class correctly, the test should pass.

  Example.

  Input:
    3
    Pesho 3
    Gosho 4
    Annie 5

  Output: 
    Annie 5
